I along with my superviser were studying a paper titled "Spacecraft smart radiation device with variable emission and low absorption based on phase change material VO2" (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2022.108039). 

This paper proposes and analyzes a vanadium dioxide (VO2)-based multilayer films structure for thermal control devices in spacecraft. It addresses the challenge posed by the miniaturization of satellites by reducing spacecraft load and size while adapting to changing thermal environments in space. The study investigates the influence of film thicknesses on emission and solar absorption, considering two optical dielectric layers: SiO2 and Al2O3.
